        <h2>Ten Commandments of Web Design</h2>
        <h3>Jeffrey Zeldman</h3>
        <a href="http://vimeo.com/84467622">Ten Commandments of Web Design - Jeffrey Zeldman at An Event Apart Austin 2013 (video)</a>
        <p>I thought this video was informative about the different ways to design a functioning webpage.  Jeffery Zeldman emphasizes the importance of an enticing webpage to grab and hold the user's attention.  He also talks about images and pictures that we use in our websites.  There are different ways to get designers or you can design your own.  Whatever you need for your website, you can create it to make your page unique.</p>

        <h2>10 things I didn't know about HTML</h2>

        <p>This video had a lot of surprising information.  Sometimes HTML does not pick up human errors like spelling mistakes or when you forget to use a semi-colon. If your webpage works, then you shouldn't worry about if the HTML code is complicated.  If the page is functioning the way you want it to, then that works.</p>
        <h4>3 Things I learned while watching this video</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Some HTML elements in the coding can only be checked by humans and a computer that tries to validate certain things will not pick up on all of the one the human would pick up on</li>
            <li>Functionality of a HTML trumps validation</li>
            <li>The semi-colon is more necessary than we think</li>
            </ul>

        <p>It is amazing how much technology can change over the years.  The speaker was even saying that just a few years back, the razor phone was popular and it uses similar but not as advanced technology as we have today.  With condesnsed pixels and internet access, cell phones have turned into smart phones which are now becoming more popular than computers and laptops.</p>
        <h4>3 Things I learned while watching this video</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Responsive web designs should minimalize the screen to have the most important and useful information and tools on it</li>
            <li>Your web page should be easy to use on a mobile device especially if people will be using your website while they are on the go, such as a tracking app for flights or paying for a ticket online</li>
            <li>The density of pixels on a mobile device can effect the use of a mobile site.  If the pixels are not dense enough to show the small buttons or text on your mobile site, it won't be easily accessible</li>
            </ul>
