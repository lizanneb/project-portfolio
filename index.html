    <p>In the merry month of June, From my home I started, Left the girls of Tuam, Nearly broken hearted, Saluted me father dear, Kissed me darling mother, Drank a pint of beer, My grief and tears to smother, Then off to reap the corn, And leave where I was born, Cut a stout blackthorn, To banish ghost and goblin, In a brand new pair of brogues, go rattling o'er the bogs, Frightening all the dogs, On the rocky road to Dublin.  One, two, three, four, five In Mullingar last night, I rested limbs so weary, Started by daylight, Next morning bright and early, Took a drop of the pure, To keep my heart from sinking, That's the Paddy's cure, When he's on the drinking. See the lassies smile, Laughing all the while, At me darling style, 'Twould set your heart a-bubbling. Asked me was I hired, The wages I required, Till I was almost tired, Of the rocky road to Dublin. One, two, three, four, five </p>
